GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.
A repository is usually used to organize a single project. Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets â€“ anything your project needs.
Branching is the way to work on different versions of a repository at one time.
By default your repository has one branch named master which is considered to be the definitive branch. We use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to master.
On GitHub, saved changes are called commits. Each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made.
